# Eduard 

Entry for RU Hacks 2021
<hr>

Eduard is an all-in-one education-focused discord bot. We recently completed our first year of (Zoom) university and wanted a way to interact with our numerous productivity tools (pomodoro timers, calendars, motivational quote pages, etc) all from the comfort of Discord, an app we already spend hours inside of. This bot was made with students in mind and has proven productivity methods like scheduling and a pomodoro timer in order to optimize workflow. We made it using discord.py, the quotes python API and Google Firebase for our database.

## Features

* Create a pomodoro timer of any length and be notified once it's over.
* Add, remove and view entries in your personal calendar.
* Get some much needed encourage-mint from one of our motivational quotes.
